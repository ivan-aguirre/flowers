Task t1 requires 3 efforts for development and 1 for tester.

If a dev have 10 efforts available the task will be available for testing.
We can see that if task is small enough, or it has been on development for days, it may be available
on the same day for testing, right after the dev has complete it.

If t1 requires 10 efforts the task may take the whole day to complete and it will be available for testing tomorrow.

We need to diffentiate both scenarios on simulation.

So far let's use a simple approach: the task will move, but it will receive effor from the tester next day, no matter what.
